# How to do Data Analysis in Power BI

Microsoft Power BI is one of the most used tools in data analysis. With an ever-rising demand for data analysis skills, gaining skills in widely adopted tools is much commendable. Today's internet world generates huge amounts of data, which requires data-driven decision making.
 
I've compiled a sterling presentation that showcases major stages for executing data analysis. The presentation walks you through a data analysis case study on “Health Crisis Analysis” in Africa for the period 2000 – 2019, using data from the UN Population Division. The data provides consistent and comparable estimates (and projections) within and across the world over the last century. The dataset used for the analysis contained six tables, 83,066 rows, tabular format and varying file types.
